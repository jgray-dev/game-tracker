                Overwatch 2 is a 2022 first-person shooter game developed and
                published by Blizzard Entertainment. As a sequel and replacement
                to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared
                environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while initially
                having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes,
                though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game
                on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce
                team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also
                reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch,
                PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
                X/S and features full cross-platform play. The game was released
                in early access on 4 October 2022. Blizzard dropped the early
                access label for the game on August 10, 2023 with the release of
                Overwatch 2's sixth season.
